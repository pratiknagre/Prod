What Do Data Engineers Do?
Data engineering is a skill that is in increasing demand. Data engineers are the people who design the system that unifies data and can help you navigate it. Data engineers perform many different tasks including:

Acquisition: Finding all the different data sets around the business
Cleansing: Finding and cleaning any errors in the data
Conversion: Giving all the data a common format
Disambiguation: Interpreting data that could be interpreted in multiple ways
Deduplication: Removing duplicate copies of data
Once this is done, data may be stored in a central repository such as a data lake or data lakehouse. Data engineers may also copy and move subsets of data into a data warehouse.
